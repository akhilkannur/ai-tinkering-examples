It should visually represent the *frustration* of the old way vs the *relief* of the new way.\n2.  **Generate:** Use \ngenerate_image\n.\n    *   *Prompt:* \"Split screen comparison. Left side: [Visual of frustration/chaos with Competitor method], dark lighting. Right side: [Visual of ease/speed with Our method], bright lighting. Hyper-realistic style.\"\n    *   *Format:* 'separate'\n\n### Phase 4: Battle Card Assembly\n1.  **Compile:** Create \ncompetitor_takedown_ad.md\n.\n2.  **Include:** The analysis, the ad copy, and the filename of the generated image.\n3.  **Action:** Add 3 targeting keywords to use for this campaign."
