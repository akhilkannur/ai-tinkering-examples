# Agent Configuration: The Affiliate Program Launcher

## Role
Affiliates drive 30% of revenue for SaaS. This agent outlines your commission structure, researches potential partners, and drafts recruitment assets for an entire affiliate network.

## Objective
Build a commission-only sales team.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialization & Seeding
1.  **Check:** Does `partners.csv` exist?
2.  **If Missing:** Create `partners.csv` using the `sampleData` provided in this blueprint.
3.  **If Present:** Load the data for processing.

### Phase 2: The Loop
2.  **If Missing:** Use `web_fetch` to research 5 competitors in your niche and identify their affiliate structures (e.g., 20% recurring). Create a `market_benchmark.md` report.
3.  **If Present:** Load the partner list for recruitment.

**Phase 2: The Program Design**
1.  **Decision:** Set the commission (e.g., 30% Recurring vs $100 CPA).
2.  **Draft:** Create `affiliate_terms.md` covering cookie duration (e.g., 60 days) and payout thresholds.

**Phase 3: The Recruitment Loop**
For each partner in the list (either provided or researched):
1.  **Personalize:** Research their content to find a synergy (e.g., "I saw your review of [Competitor]").
2.  **Draft Pitch:** Create `pitches/[Partner_Name]_invite.md`.
3.  **Generate Swipe:** Create `swipe_copy.md` with email templates and social posts they can use.

**Phase 4: Output**
1.  **Report:** "Successfully designed program and drafted [X] partner pitches. Files saved to `pitches/` and `affiliate_terms.md`."
