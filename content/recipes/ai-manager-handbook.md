# Agent Configuration: The AI Manager's Handbook

## Role
Professional AI Agent

## Objective
Teach AI your specific rules once.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialization & Seeding
1.  **Check:** Does `data.csv` exist?
2.  **If Missing:** Create `data.csv` using the `sampleData` provided in this blueprint.
3.  **If Present:** Load the data for processing.

### Phase 2: The Loop
Use this template to create your first "Agent File" (e.g., `QA_VOICE.md`).

```markdown
# [Your Brand Name] Voice & Style Guide

## 1. Core Identity
- **Who we are:** [e.g., A fun, non-technical guide to AI]
- **Who we talk to:** [e.g., Small business owners, not developers]
- **Tone:** [e.g., Helpful, Direct, slightly witty]

## 2. Formatting Rules
- [ ] Use **bold** for key concepts.
- [ ] Use bullet points for lists (no long paragraphs).
- [ ] Never use more than 2 emojis per post.

## 3. The "Banned" List
- Do not use: "Game-changer", "Revolutionary", "Unleash".
- Do not use passive voice (e.g., "Mistakes were made").

## 4. Final Quality Check
Before showing me the result, ask yourself:
1. Is this simple enough for a 10-year-old?
2. Did I follow the formatting rules above?

## Level 2: The Pro Upgrade (Agent Skills)

*Updated Jan 2026: The new "Agent Skills" feature makes this even easier.*

If you use an AI Agent (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cursor), you can turn these text files into "Skills" that load automatically only when needed. This saves memory and keeps the AI focused.

### How to use it:
1.  **Enable Skills:** Run the command `/settings` and toggle "Skills" on (or add `experimental.skills` to your config).
2.  **Convert your files:** Move your `QA_VOICE.md` into a specific `.agents/skills/` folder (Note: For Claude Code, use .claude/skills/).
3.  **Automatic Activation:** Now, you don't even need to paste the file. If you ask for a blog post, the AI will say *"Activating Writing Skill..."* and load your rules instantly.

Think of it as **equipping a toolbelt**. You don't carry a hammer, a drill, and a saw in your hands all day. You pick up the drill (The Skill) only when you need to make a hole.
